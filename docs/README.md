# Blog Roll
A machine learning personal blog with very clear points and python code for you to understand even clearer! [link](https://stmorse.github.io/blog.html). I discovered his blog while researching on hawkes fitting, and was so very impressed by his researches.

A behavior psychology personal blog with very down to earth posts that may help you in daily life: [link](https://johnhenryp.com/). My personal favorite is Quitting Facebook, a behavior approach. You gotta try the code (*hint hint*) in the end, it will change your life!
